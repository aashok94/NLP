[Enter ROMEO]

Benvolio: See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
Montague. I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]

Benvolio. Good-morrow, cousin.
Romeo. Is the day so young?
Benvolio. But new struck nine.
Romeo. Ay me! sad hours seem long.
Was that my father that went hence so fast?
Benvolio. It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
Romeo. Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
Benvolio. In love?
Romeo. Out-
Benvolio: Of love?
Romeo: Out of her favour, where I am in love.
Benvolio. Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
Romeo: Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still
Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
O any thing, of nothing first create!
O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
sick health!
Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
This love #5 feel I, that feel no love in this.
Dost thou not laugh?
Benvolio. No, coz, I rather weep.
